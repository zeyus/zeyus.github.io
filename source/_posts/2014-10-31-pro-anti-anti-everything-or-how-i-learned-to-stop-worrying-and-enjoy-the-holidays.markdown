## Pro anti-anti-everything

Let's see, what can we rail against today:

* Halloween
* Christmas
* Easter
* St Patricks day (well for some reason Aussies think this is completely OK)
* Valentine's Day
* Mother's day
* Father's day
* Festivus

(is the word "today" one of the biggest song fill words?)


I'm not going to make this a long post (famous last words).

It's past time I posted publicly on this, it's something that comes up every single time there's any kind of holiday event and it's extremely frustrating, at least to me. 

![no halloween here cunts, this is 'straya](/images/halloween_free_zone.jpg)

This is 'Straya cunts, we don't celebrate that yankee crap here...

Wait...what?? Why not??

First of all, Halloween is not even a US celebration, if you took 2 seconds to do some research you'd find that outm it's actually of Christian, Gaelic origin.

Now that that's out of the way, I want to address just a few of the common ideas about why X celebration is bad and my response to it.

### Christmas/easter/etc forgets its roots

So fucking what, it's probably not what you're thinking anyway, Christmas is a pagan winter solstice celebration, easter is most likely a celebration of the goddess Ä’ostre. Just celebrate and enjoy with the people you want to.

### These holidays are created/endorsed by big corporations

Really? So the fact they existed before these corporations doesn't mean anything to you? You choose where you buy things from.

Also related is...

### It just promotes mindless consumerism

Several things here

* People buying things creates jobs for other people (YOU DON'T SAY????) Even the toys that the kids love, even the candies you hand out
* You can buy halloween/christmas/easter/festivus decorations OR you can make them yourself!
* Giving people shit is a good way to feel nice about yourself and to make them feel appreciated

But I don't need to do this becacuse...

### I make my mother/father/partner/satan feel special every day of the year

And?? That means you can't have another special day? Or you don't like the idea of making another day all about them? Really?

### I don't like to see other people dressing up, having fun, smiling

That's your problem, go inside, lock your door, and come out after the end of civilisation
