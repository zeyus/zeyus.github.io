<p>Let&rsquo;s see, what can we rail against today:</p>

<ul>
<li>Halloween</li>
<li>Christmas</li>
<li>Easter</li>
<li>St Patricks day (well for some reason Aussies think this is completely OK)</li>
<li>Valentine&rsquo;s Day</li>
<li>Mother&rsquo;s day</li>
<li>Father&rsquo;s day</li>
<li>Festivus</li>
</ul>

<p>(is the word &ldquo;today&rdquo; one of the biggest song fill words?)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not going to make this a long post (famous last words).</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s past time I posted publicly on this, it&rsquo;s something that comes up every single time there&rsquo;s any kind of holiday event and it&rsquo;s extremely frustrating, at least to me.</p>

<p><img src="/images/halloween_free_zone.jpg" alt="no halloween here cunts, this is 'straya" /></p>

<p>This is &lsquo;Straya cunts, we don&rsquo;t celebrate that yankee crap here&hellip;</p>

<p>Wait&hellip;what?? Why not??</p>

<p>First of all, Halloween is not even a US celebration, if you took 2 seconds to do some research you&rsquo;d find that outm it&rsquo;s actually of Christian, Gaelic origin.</p>

<p>Now that that&rsquo;s out of the way, I want to address just a few of the common ideas about why X celebration is bad and my response to it.</p>

<h3>Christmas/easter/etc forgets its roots</h3>

<p>So fucking what, it&rsquo;s probably not what you&rsquo;re thinking anyway, Christmas is a pagan winter solstice celebration, easter is most likely a celebration of the goddess Ä’ostre. Just celebrate and enjoy with the people you want to.</p>

<h3>These holidays are created/endorsed by big corporations</h3>

<p>Really? So the fact they existed before these corporations doesn&rsquo;t mean anything to you? You choose where you buy things from.</p>

<p>Also related is&hellip;</p>

<h3>It just promotes mindless consumerism</h3>

<p>Several things here</p>

<ul>
<li>People buying things creates jobs for other people (YOU DON&rsquo;T SAY????) Even the toys that the kids love, even the candies you hand out</li>
<li>You can buy halloween/christmas/easter/festivus decorations OR you can make them yourself!</li>
<li>Giving people shit is a good way to feel nice about yourself and to make them feel appreciated</li>
</ul>


<p>But I don&rsquo;t need to do this becacuse&hellip;</p>

<h3>I make my mother/father/partner/satan feel special every day of the year</h3>

<p>And?? That means you can&rsquo;t have another special day? Or you don&rsquo;t like the idea of making another day all about them? Really?</p>

<h3>I don&rsquo;t like to see other people dressing up, having fun, smiling</h3>

<p>That&rsquo;s your problem, go inside, lock your door, and come out after the end of civilisation</p>
