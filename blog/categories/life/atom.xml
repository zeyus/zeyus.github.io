    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p> thought that now might be as good a time as any to write about about my life. As you can see, it&rsquo;s on my blog, it&rsquo;s not going to be a bestseller and I&rsquo;m doing it for me. If it so happens that you enjoy reading it, all the better!</p>

<p>Be warned: as far as I know there is no murder or CSI style investigations. Because I&rsquo;m not drafting, editing and proofing this, it might not be as coherent or polished as it should be. Some parts will be too light on detail, and others too heavy.</p>

<p>Part one is going to end when I&rsquo;ve written as much as I feel like tonight.</p>

<h2>Â Pre history</h2>

<p>I was born in Penrith, a medium size city to the west of Sydney. My dad is an electrician, he has always worked hard and is most happy when he has a million things to do. My mum is a school teacher, she was born in Finland and came over when she was young. My parents went to the same school together.</p>

<p><img src="/images/young_mum.jpg" title="&lsquo;mum with mummu&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>My parents had travelled a lot around Australia, and in the case of my dad, the world. He spent about a year backpacking all over the place. I don&rsquo;t remember with certainty but it included Europe and India at least.</p>

<p><img src="/images/young_mum.jpg" title="&lsquo;young dad travelling&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>They tell me that they weren&rsquo;t particularly religious before the Jehovah&rsquo;s Witnesses came knocking at their door, and were seemingly skeptical about what the JWs were offering. I&rsquo;m not sure if they were called on at a vulnerable point in their lives, but for whatever reason, they started a bible study[*][#fn0001] with the witnesses.</p>

<p>Dad and mum were married on a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paddle_steamer">paddle steamer</a> on the Nepean River. It was a small affair with only close friends and family in attendance.</p>

<p>The first place I lived in was a 3 bedroom house in the foot of the blue mountains. I have fond memories of this place. It had a decent sized yard, a pool and a sauna (which is probably my most loved thing about the place - my dad built a sauna in the places we lived for my mum. It&rsquo;s very Finnish.) My grandmother (mummu) lived there too, but she had a granny flat above the garage which allowed her to be independent.</p>

<p>There are lots of photos of holidays I went on, long before I can remember, I have a few flashes here and there, but not many. I know we went yearly down to camp by the beach in southern New South Wales, we made fires, caught fish, swam and were surrounded by wildlife.</p>

<p><img src="/images/baby_me.jpg" width="400" height="400" title="&lsquo;baby Luke&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t remember my sister being born two years after me, as far as I remember she&rsquo;s always been there.</p>

<h2>First memories - school</h2>

<p>Actually, my memory from my whole youth is piecemeal and hopefully writing this dawn might help recall more. There are things I do remember though, like making a volcano with food dye, vinegar and baking soda, and before that a memory of burning my ass on a fireplace. I had to go to hospital for it, I don&rsquo;t remember that part, but I do remember the reason I was naked in front of the fireplace was because I&rsquo;d just bathed, and I wanted to get warm and dry, in doing so I guess I got a little closer than what you might call a safe distance. Lesson learned, I never did that again.</p>

<p>I remember my a few things from my first year and a bit of school. Once I got detention for kicking my shoes over the fence accidentally in a game my friends and I thought was hilarious. The game was such: loosen the lace on your shoe and lift the tongue up. Kick your leg forward as vigorously as possible, and see how far your shoe goes. Collect shoe. Repeat. Of course it was great fun up until the point where the shoe went soaring over the fence, and after being told off, we had to sheepishly knock on the neighbour&rsquo;s door and ask for the safe return of said footwear. Luckily (living next to a school) they were probably used to articles of clothing landing in their yard and helpfully returned my shoe. If I remember rightly, these shoes had a pump in the tongue which inflated it when pressed, they seemed to make me happy,</p>

<p>I had a little crew of friends that used to play soccer and roam the schoolyard together, I don&rsquo;t remember much of our conversations but they probably revolved around lunch, who&rsquo;s dad is better, and who we did and didn&rsquo;t like in class. I remember one classmate called Sarah with whom I was smitten and she would be the one I&rsquo;d always go after in &ldquo;Kiss and catch.&rdquo; Of course in a dancing lesson i remember, I hoped that I would be paired with her - instead, as there were more boys in my class, I got stuck with a redhead kid called Corey who had warts on his hands and wasn&rsquo;t thought of fondly by my gang.</p>

<p>At some point I wanted / was encouraged to learn an instrument, so I decided on the piano. Little did I know how seriously my parents would take this, forcing me to practice an hour a day and take exams and perform in eisteddfods and talent shows. Eeek, held to a decision you made when you&rsquo;re 4 or 5 for the next 8 years is pretty hardcore. (It was made far less fun for me because the music is chosen for you when you take the AMEB exams, usually classical music which my 4-27 year old self had/has very little interest in.)</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s not much else that stands out from there except I was bored in class, and the teachers had me sit a test and because I did so well they decided I should skip a year, and I think there was some &ldquo;gifted and talented&rdquo; class in there somewhere too. I think that was a mistake because I missed out on some fundamental education that meant I had to play catchup, and I suppose that&rsquo;s what lead to my incessant complaining of school. I asked my mum to teach me at home because she&rsquo;s a teacher - and she did.</p>

<p>So my school years ended abruptly and my new life at home began.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it for today and I guess I&rsquo;ll continue from where I left off here at some point.</p>

    <id>http://www.zeyus.com/blog/2014/01/15/coming-to-terms</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>The path that was</h2>

<p>Oh I never had very high expectations of what would become of my life. I was taught from the moment I can remember that this life was just a transient state, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t invest too much in this life, prepare for the one to come!&rdquo; or &ldquo;&lsquo;The Truth&rsquo; [JW speak for the JW religion] isn&rsquo;t a religion, it&rsquo;s a way of life.&rdquo; or &ldquo;Satan roves about like a roaring lion waiting to devour&hellip;&rdquo; Constant quotes, pithy phrases and one-liners were thrown at me. Most of them with the outward intention of bolstering my faith but always with a more sinister message of spending even more time focusing on religion and sparing no time for other activities.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I&rsquo;ll probably go into a lot more detail on my upbringing in a future post, but for now the focus is on my current state of mind.</p>

<p>From when I was very young I had a love of science and technology. I got to read a lot but always through the blind eyes of faith. I read in awe books about our amazing planet and life on it, yet managed to ignore any reference to evolution (and anything else that went against my &ldquo;truth&rdquo;) and in doing so feel proud of myself that I had the right answer, all the scientists were wrong. They were just too smart to see the simplistic beauty that was a divine creator, if only they would pick up their bibles. Ugh, I sucked.</p>

<p>It took an exceptionally long time to clear out everything that had been forced into my mind from years of spoon fed, watered down misinformation - I had to start from zero. A humbling experience, finding out that almost every single thing you thought you knew and believed to the core was wrong. I had to question everything, I researched minute detail, I read lots (and will continue to do so) on science and critical thinking.</p>

<p>Between those two stages, I was left seemingly without purpose. I didn&rsquo;t mind though, I adopted a somewhat hedonistic approach to life, self destructive perhaps. I worked, I did my part, but amidst that was a bunch of excesses that weren&rsquo;t easy to curb.</p>

<p>Somewhere around that time I met my amazing wife and we were soon smitten with each other, luckily for us we even out each other&rsquo;s extremes in just the right way. Her presence, constant support, intelligence and enthusiasm kept me learning new things and examining the status quo.</p>

<h2>The now</h2>

<p>Thanks in a exceptionally large part to her, I am where I am today. In a happy relationship with 2 beautiful kids, living in a nice area of a great city with a good job. Many people would be envious, some scornful, though I never thought I based my decisions on what would bring me the most accolade from others. By many measures of life, and despite my upbringing I have achieved success, and yet it doesnât feel like it.</p>

<p>Andrea and I talked about this and she asked what it would take to bring about that feeling. I honestly do not know. It&rsquo;s not about not being content with what I have - I am, very much so. I appreciate how well things are for me I love nearly every aspect of my life. Partly it stems from a desire to leave a lasting contribution, something that matters, maybe something that would make up for all my wasted time and even poisonous input into society. (You probably didn&rsquo;t think twice about it, but sorry if I ever knocked on your door and tried to scare you into thinking that the world is horrible and you need saving.)</p>

<p>The result of this melancholic state was that (with some nudging) I have done some thinking and written this blog post almost as a fluid thought process. Andrea pointed out that I have more time now to pursue my interests, I no longer have the option of squandering my time on activities that I used to like going out several nights every week. Basically the hours between 19:00-22:00 are mine, I&rsquo;m not going to make the best use of every minute, and my wife and kids will always come first, but I can force myself to make at least some nights count!</p>

<h2>The path that may be</h2>

<p><img src="/images/wtf.png" width="400" height="400" title="jump" ></p>

<p>So what can I contribute? What am I passionate about? I have no idea, really, so as a beginning I&rsquo;ve compiled a list of things that I want to do. This is not a new year&rsquo;s resolution, it&rsquo;s not a to do or a bucket list. It&rsquo;s just a vague list, but I will do some of these things, some I&rsquo;ve even started. Others could turn into goals - both long and short term. Some things may be added and others struck off. It is a start, a first step in the right direction, a slight narrowing of a broad cacophony of sentiments and ideas.</p>

<ul>
<li>Write, AND FINISH a song</li>
<li>Sing that song or another one to Andrea</li>
<li>Write a story (length and genre not specified) and submit it somewhere</li>
<li>Write an (mobile or desktop) application</li>
<li>Own a successful business (in what? define success?)</li>
<li>Learn another programming language</li>
<li>Speak Spanish at home</li>
<li>Learn a third spoken language</li>
<li>Plan more</li>
<li>Write more in this blog</li>
<li>Live in another country</li>
<li>Buy a house</li>
<li>Grow a nice edible garden</li>
<li>Read more</li>
<li>Go to university (not just work at one. hah)</li>
<li>Help educate people (specifically in critical thinking)</li>
<li>Fight misinformation</li>
<li>Attend a conference (TED maybe?)</li>
<li>&hellip;?</li>
</ul>


<p>That&rsquo;s it for now. I will keep track of new things I think of or other things I remember and add them here.</p>

<p>Just getting to this point has been a good thing, and setting some long term goals, defining them and keeping them in mind requires an attitude shift and lots of thought. I have a bad track record when it comes to that, but then again, I know nothing&hellip;but I&rsquo;m willing to learn!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<iframe width="420" height="315" src="//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/W-7m8fnfLTk?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>So, I originally started this post planning to cover various topics, but I think I&rsquo;ll tackle them one at a time&hellip;there&rsquo;s too much to cover and some research involved.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve just got so upset with the amount of bad content that I see constantly posted and reposted on Facebook or elsewhere, it&rsquo;s frustrating, it&rsquo;s saddening, and it shows a general lack of interest in thinking. It doesn&rsquo;t take long to visit a few websites such as <a href="http://www.snopes.com/">snopes</a>, <a href="http://rationalwiki.org/">RationalWiki</a> or <a href="http://skepdic.com/">The Skeptic&rsquo;s Dictionary</a>. Really, it just takes a few moments of your time and you might be blown away by the things you find.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>It took me such a long time to come around to thinking critically, but when I did, it was exciting, it was as if I got <a href="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507dba43c4aabcfd2216a447/t/51a2302de4b0e2549bbe8028/1369583665476/photo%20(18).PNG">a new start</a> in life. It was invigorating, it was tough and it has been totally worth it. Ignorance is not an excuse, ignorance is not bliss.</p>

<p>For the most part of my life so far, I went along thinking that I had to be told what to believe, and took things at face value, but now I&rsquo;ve lerned to do my own research and adjust my thinking if I&rsquo;m wrong. It&rsquo;s made me a better person, though perhaps more vitriolic than before - that&rsquo;s a side effect of seeing people you care about sucked into believing ridiculous things.</p>

<p>Two things which are worth constantly remembering are:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/view/520156/memory-is-inherently-fallible-and-thats-a-good-thing/">Memory is fallible</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/the-role-of-anecdotes-in-science-based-medicine/">Anecdote is unreliable</a></li>
</ul>


<h2>Older X is better</h2>

<p>Normally in one of the following forms:</p>

<ul>
<li>[Insert appliance/thing here] were made so much better before</li>
<li>Life was so much better X years ago</li>
<li>New technology X is ruining our lives / making us less social</li>
</ul>


<p>I want to briefly address them one by one:</p>

<h3>Quality of construction</h3>

<p>This is easy, and something my wife and I have discussed several times. The appliance manufacturers do not put in time bombs into your dishwasher, vacuum cleaner, PC, mobile phone or printer so they die just out of warranty&hellip;but there are several important points to be made:</p>

<p><em>Things are a lot cheaper now.</em> for example a brand new washing machine in 1970 would cost you <a href="http://www.gti.net/mocolib1/prices/1970.html">around US $130</a>, but your yearly (median household) income was <a href="http://www.davemanuel.com/median-household-income.php">around US $7600</a>. Now you can find a washing machine for <a href="http://www.homedepot.com/p/Maytag-Centennial-3-6-cu-ft-High-Efficiency-Top-Load-Washer-in-White-ENERGY-STAR-MVWC360AW/203667281">about US $400 or less</a> - but the 2012 median income is about <a href="http://www.davemanuel.com/median-household-income.php">about US $50,000</a>.
That means an average household can now buy over 2 washing machines per year for every 1 they could back in 1970! (0.8% of yearly income vs 1.71%).</p>

<p><em>Grandpa knew how to fix the washing machine.</em> It DID break down, but it was fixed at home. Some people can still do that, others can&rsquo;t.</p>

<p><em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias">Confirmation bias</a> &amp; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anecdotal_evidence">anecdote</a> reign supreme.</em> the articles / blogs I found saying &ldquo;modern&rdquo; things are worse were written without evidence, and were along the lines of &ldquo;my washing machine broke down after 10 years, I bought a new one and it died after 2.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s not evidence, at least not by itself&hellip;Do you know the manufacturer return rates then vs now? What about giving a product time to see how long it lasts, a 2 year old product logically can&rsquo;t have anyone using it for 10 years! Besides, <a href="http://aceee.org/research-report/a132">this isn&rsquo;t necessarily the truth</a>. Modern appliances function better and are more efficient, saving you money in more ways than one.</p>

<h3>The good ol&#8217; days</h3>

<p>Anyone who knows me has probably heard me rant about this more than once&hellip;</p>

<p>I won&rsquo;t go into great detail but.</p>

<p><em>Violent crime is down</em> see the following image of violent crime by gender per 1000 people: (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_in_the_United_States">via wikipedia</a>)
<img class="<a" src="href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/66/Violent_crime_rates_by_gender_1973-2003.jpg">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/66/Violent_crime_rates_by_gender_1973-2003.jpg</a>&#8221; title=&#8221;&lsquo;Violent crime is down&rsquo; &lsquo;Wikipedia Image showing violent crime per 1000&rsquo;&#8221; ></p>

<p><em>Life expectancy is up!</em> If you were lucky enough to be born in the 1850s you would have a <a href="http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0005140.html">lovely life expectancy</a> of <strong>38.3</strong>* years. If you were born in 2004, that age now becomes <strong>75.7!</strong> Going further back in time than 1850, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy">things are just as grim</a>.</p>

<h3>Kids these days / AKA the good ol&#8217; days part 2</h3>

<p>Something oft repeated&hellip;&ldquo;this generation is worse.&rdquo; &ldquo;Technology is driving us apart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As always. There&rsquo;s a <a href="http://xkcd.com/1227/">relevant XKCD</a> which nicely illustrates how people have been saying the same things for a long time!</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s an excerpt from a 1908 essay on ancient Greek Schools entitled <a href="http://www.archive.org/stream/schoolsofhellasa008878mbp#page/n105/mode/2up/search/indictment">&ldquo;Schools of Hella - An Essay On The Practice And Theory Of Ancient Greek Education From 600 To 300 BC&rdquo;</a> by Kenneth J. Freeman.</p>

<p><img src="/images/schoolsofhellas.jpg" /></p>

<blockquote><p>The counts of indictment are luxury, bad manners, contempt for authority, disrespect to elders, and a love for chatter in place of exercise.</p></blockquote>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<blockquote><p>Children began to be the tyrants, not the slaves of their households. They no longer rose from their seats when an elder entered the room ; they contradicted their parents, chattered before company, gobbled up the dainties at the table, and committed various offences against Hellenic tastes, such as crossing their legs.</p></blockquote>

<p>Kids these days are getting out of control.</p>

<p>People are afraid of change, time after time we see the same issues come up as long as you can go back. I hate it now that horses are domesticated, people are leaving their villages and families and it&rsquo;s tearing society apart!</p>

<h2>Anyone who does X is stupid</h2>

<p>While there are <a href="http://www.darwinawards.com/">many exceptions</a> to this, the attitude of putting people into baskets is so detrimental. It means before you even get a chance to understand their reasoning, you&rsquo;ve already judged them and even if you are wrong, you still experience <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias">confirmation bias</a>.</p>

<p>Example: All goth kids are depressed.</p>

<ul>
<li>JP: Hi Goth Kid</li>
<li>GK: Hi Judgmental Person</li>
<li>JP: How&rsquo;s it going?</li>
<li>GK: good thanks, it&rsquo;s a great day today but I&rsquo;m not looking forward to going to work tomorrow</li>
<li>JP: I knew it, you have such a bleary outlook on life</li>
<li>GK: Oh, so you&rsquo;re looking forward to work then?</li>
<li>JP: No, but&hellip;</li>
</ul>


<p>Next time you tell a story think, why are you mentioning the race of the person or their sexual orientation as part of the story (unless it&rsquo;s strictly relevant). I don&rsquo;t often hear stories about this Australian driver (unless you&rsquo;re overseas and then you can hear the Aussie jokes&hellip;), or this straight guy. You&rsquo;re leading the listener on with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loaded_language">loaded language</a> and reinforcing stereotypes, even if it&rsquo;s unintentional.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>This turned out longer than I expected, but there is so much material to cover and I feel like I haven&rsquo;t done it justice. I would love to discuss this more and I have some ideas for the content of my next post.</p>

<p><strong>Just think!</strong></p>
