<div class="entry-content"><h2>The path that was</h2>

<p>Oh I never had very high expectations of what would become of my life. I was taught from the moment I can remember that this life was just a transient state, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t invest too much in this life, prepare for the one to come!&rdquo; or &ldquo;&lsquo;The Truth&rsquo; [JW speak for the JW religion] isn&rsquo;t a religion, it&rsquo;s a way of life.&rdquo; or &ldquo;Satan roves about like a roaring lion waiting to devour&hellip;&rdquo; Constant quotes, pithy phrases and one-liners were thrown at me. Most of them with the outward intention of bolstering my faith but always with a more sinister message of spending even more time focusing on religion and sparing no time for other activities.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I&rsquo;ll probably go into a lot more detail on my upbringing in a future post, but for now the focus is on my current state of mind.</p>

<p>From when I was very young I had a love of science and technology. I got to read a lot but always through the blind eyes of faith. I read in awe books about our amazing planet and life on it, yet managed to ignore any reference to evolution (and anything else that went against my &ldquo;truth&rdquo;) and in doing so feel proud of myself that I had the right answer, all the scientists were wrong. They were just too smart to see the simplistic beauty that was a divine creator, if only they would pick up their bibles. Ugh, I sucked.</p>

<p>It took an exceptionally long time to clear out everything that had been forced into my mind from years of spoon fed, watered down misinformation - I had to start from zero. A humbling experience, finding out that almost every single thing you thought you knew and believed to the core was wrong. I had to question everything, I researched minute detail, I read lots (and will continue to do so) on science and critical thinking.</p>

<p>Between those two stages, I was left seemingly without purpose. I didn&rsquo;t mind though, I adopted a somewhat hedonistic approach to life, self destructive perhaps. I worked, I did my part, but amidst that was a bunch of excesses that weren&rsquo;t easy to curb.</p>

<p>Somewhere around that time I met my amazing wife and we were soon smitten with each other, luckily for us we even out each other&rsquo;s extremes in just the right way. Her presence, constant support, intelligence and enthusiasm kept me learning new things and examining the status quo.</p>

<h2>The now</h2>

<p>Thanks in a exceptionally large part to her, I am where I am today. In a happy relationship with 2 beautiful kids, living in a nice area of a great city with a good job. Many people would be envious, some scornful, though I never thought I based my decisions on what would bring me the most accolade from others. By many measures of life, and despite my upbringing I have achieved success, and yet it doesnâ€™t feel like it.</p>

<p>Andrea and I talked about this and she asked what it would take to bring about that feeling. I honestly do not know. It&rsquo;s not about not being content with what I have - I am, very much so. I appreciate how well things are for me I love nearly every aspect of my life. Partly it stems from a desire to leave a lasting contribution, something that matters, maybe something that would make up for all my wasted time and even poisonous input into society. (You probably didn&rsquo;t think twice about it, but sorry if I ever knocked on your door and tried to scare you into thinking that the world is horrible and you need saving.)</p>

<p>The result of this melancholic state was that (with some nudging) I have done some thinking and written this blog post almost as a fluid thought process. Andrea pointed out that I have more time now to pursue my interests, I no longer have the option of squandering my time on activities that I used to like going out several nights every week. Basically the hours between 19:00-22:00 are mine, I&rsquo;m not going to make the best use of every minute, and my wife and kids will always come first, but I can force myself to make at least some nights count!</p>

<h2>The path that may be</h2>

<p><img src="/images/wtf.png" width="400" height="400" title="jump" ></p>

<p>So what can I contribute? What am I passionate about? I have no idea, really, so as a beginning I&rsquo;ve compiled a list of things that I want to do. This is not a new year&rsquo;s resolution, it&rsquo;s not a to do or a bucket list. It&rsquo;s just a vague list, but I will do some of these things, some I&rsquo;ve even started. Others could turn into goals - both long and short term. Some things may be added and others struck off. It is a start, a first step in the right direction, a slight narrowing of a broad cacophony of sentiments and ideas.</p>

<ul>
<li>Write, AND FINISH a song</li>
<li>Sing that song or another one to Andrea</li>
<li>Write a story (length and genre not specified) and submit it somewhere</li>
<li>Write an (mobile or desktop) application</li>
<li>Own a successful business (in what? define success?)</li>
<li>Learn another programming language</li>
<li>Speak Spanish at home</li>
<li>Learn a third spoken language</li>
<li>Plan more</li>
<li>Write more in this blog</li>
<li>Live in another country</li>
<li>Buy a house</li>
<li>Grow a nice edible garden</li>
<li>Read more</li>
<li>Go to university (not just work at one. hah)</li>
<li>Help educate people (specifically in critical thinking)</li>
<li>Fight misinformation</li>
<li>Attend a conference (TED maybe?)</li>
<li>&hellip;?</li>
</ul>


<p>That&rsquo;s it for now. I will keep track of new things I think of or other things I remember and add them here.</p>

<p>Just getting to this point has been a good thing, and setting some long term goals, defining them and keeping them in mind requires an attitude shift and lots of thought. I have a bad track record when it comes to that, but then again, I know nothing&hellip;but I&rsquo;m willing to learn!</p>
